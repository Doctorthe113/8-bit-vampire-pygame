# Hello there!
This is my first ever completed game. I made it with pygame.

## To play:
1. Get python on your machine and then run `pip install pygame`
2. Open a terminal in the main directory and run `python game.py` or `python3 game.py`.

I don't have any plans for any future update. This was just a fun project to learn about pygame and practically use classes in python.
Thanks for checking it out! Have fun!
